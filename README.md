# Bloodmoon Collection

Hi, my name is Trung Kien Nguyen (MOON) !!!

You should run this program in YOUR OWN DEVICE!
Just run the Bloodmoon.rb file to run the program, the other files are sub-files only
This program uses Ruby version 2.5.1p57 (2018/03/29 revision 63029) [x64-mingw32], with libraries of Gosu version 1.4.3, Ruby2d 0.10.0,
so make sure you have installed the suitable version!

P/s: In the demo video I will only try to give a clear and overall instruction of how to use the program and play the four games, for more information, especially the code explanation, please see my attached report pdf file!!

After finishing your playings as the instructions in my video, you can see all your results in the Output.txt file!!

If you have any questions about the program (errors, misunderstandings, ...), please email to 104053642@student.swin.edu.au or moonoftrungkien2004@gmail.com

Thank you very much!!
