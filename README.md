# Bloodmoon Collection

Hi, my name is Trung Kien Nguyen (MOON) !!!

You should run this program in YOUR OWN DEVICE!
Just run the Bloodmoon.rb file to run the program, the other files are sub-files only
This program uses Ruby version 2.5.1p57 (2018/03/29 revision 63029) [x64-mingw32], with libraries of Gosu version 1.4.3, Ruby2d 0.10.0,
so make sure you have installed the suitable version!

You must go to the link to download the 'Media' folder!
Please go to the following link to download the Media folder used for my custom program

or

NOTICE: After downloading, and extracting, please rename the folder to exactly 
"Media" to fit with the code, and make sure you put this folder in the same 
directory with the five ruby files.

To have a look on my program, please see the Custom Code Demonstration Video in:

P/s: In this video I will only try to give a clear and overall instruction of how to use the program and play the four games, for more information, especially the code explanation, please see my attached report pdf file!!

After finishing your playings as the instructions in my video, you can see all your results in the Output.txt file!!

If you have any questions about the program (errors, misunderstandings, ...), please email to 104053642@student.swin.edu.au or moonoftrungkien2004@gmail.com

Thank you very much!!
